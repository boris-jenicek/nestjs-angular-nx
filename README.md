# Welcome to Our Cutting-Edge Fullstack App!

Dive into a world where **Clean Architecture** meets the dynamic duo of **NestJS** and **Angular**â€”all within the versatile realm of an **NX monorepo**. This app embodies modern development practices, aiming to provide an enjoyable experience for both developers and users. Additionally, the application integrates Git hooks to streamline and enforce code quality checks locally, including commit linting, code linting, and tests.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

Begin by setting up each part of the application with the following instructions:

### ðŸ›  Backend Configuration

Our backend, built on NestJS alongside TypeORM, adheres to Clean Architecture principles for enhanced maintainability and scalability. Start your backend setup with:

- [Backend Magic Unleashed](./neox-api/README.md)

### ðŸŒŸ Frontend Configuration

Developed with Angular, our frontend is designed for a dynamic and responsive user experience. Begin your frontend journey with:

- [Frontend Wonder World](./neox-fe/README.md)

### ðŸ“Œ Utilizing Git Hooks

To leverage Git hooks for automating CI/CD tasks locally, such as commitlint, code lint, and tests, ensure to install Husky in the root folder:

```bash
npm install
```

This step installs Husky, which manages the Git hooks, ensuring your code meets the project's quality standards before each commit.

## ðŸ’¡ Let's Get Developing!

With both environments prepared, you're all set to develop across both the backend and frontend seamlessly. The setup guides aim to facilitate a smooth initial configuration process.
